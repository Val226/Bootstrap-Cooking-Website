<h2>Let's Learn to Bake!</h2>
<p>Baking is an art, some would say it is a difficult art; Others don't agree. Our goal is to make the baking experience fun and stress-free</p>
<p>You'll find there are many levels to cooking, and that is because things like sourdough bread takes more knowledge and practice than cookies. Our class levels are broken into different groups because of this, but they are reccomendations more than anything.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind: We will do our best to accommodate dietary restrictions, but we are not perfect. Please let your instructor know of any dietary restrictions you are working with.</p>
