# Bootstrap-Cooking-Website
 
My project is a website for a school that has cooking and baking classes


Instructions:
In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
Create a .gitignore file containing the text: node_modules
Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository.
Create a Video showcasing your assignment.
Keep Track of the URLs for this week's GitHub repository and Video upload.
Submit both URLs in the Submission Text Box on this page!

Coding Steps:
Create a new website using HTML and Bootstrap. 
The website must include the following:
At least 2 pages.
A Bootstrap navbar, table, and form.
Bootstrap grid used throughout to format elements
Elements should stack vertically when the window is small


Video Steps:

Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
This will create a video recording on your computer.
This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
