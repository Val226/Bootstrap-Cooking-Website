  <h2>Let's get to Cooking!</h2>
  <p>
    Let's be honest, if we didn't have anything to eat we wouldn't make it long. Food is arguably the most important thing to have in your life.
    Cooking is not really an exact science as baking can be. Cooking is a lot of "a bit of this" "a dash of that", which is why so many people
    have a hard time with cooking. When you leave each class, you'll have a recipe to share with your friends.

            We will then move to a safe, controlled area outdoors where you will learn to start and maintain a fire, as well
            as how to cook the meals you prepped inside.
